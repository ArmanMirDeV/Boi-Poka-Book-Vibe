    "review": "A groundbreaking exploration of female desire and agency in early 20th century Bengal. Binodini, a young widow, disrupts the comfortable household of her childhood friend with her unconventional desires and refusal to accept society's restrictions. Tagore crafts a complex psychological portrait of a woman fighting against the suffocating norms imposed on widows. The novel examines jealousy, friendship, love, and the limited choices available to women. Tagore's progressive views on women's autonomy and his nuanced characterization make this a landmark feminist text that remains relevant today, challenging patriarchal structures and celebrating female complexity.",

    "review": "Wilde's only novel tells of beautiful Dorian Gray, who wishes his portrait would age instead of him. As he indulges in hedonism and moral corruption, the painting bears the marks of his sins while he remains youthful. This Gothic masterpiece explores vanity, moral corruption, art's relationship to life, and the consequences of living without ethical constraints. Wilde's witty epigrams and philosophical dialogues about aestheticism make it both entertaining and thought-provoking. The novel's examination of beauty's power, conscience, and the hidden costs of eternal youth remains relevant, offering a cautionary tale about sacrificing morality for pleasure and appearance.",

    "review": "Tartt's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel follows Theo Decker, who survives a terrorist attack at an art museum that kills his mother. He steals a painting—'The Goldfinch'—which becomes both his salvation and burden as he navigates grief, guilt, and a criminal underworld. The sprawling narrative explores art's redemptive power, loss, addiction, and the randomness of survival. Tartt's rich prose and complex plot create a modern Dickensian tale examining how tragedy shapes lives and art provides meaning. The novel's meditation on beauty, mortality, and the things we cling to makes it a contemporary classic about finding purpose in chaos.",

The narrative challenges Western portrayals of Africa, presenting a complex, functioning society destroyed by colonialism. Achebe explores tradition versus change, masculinity, cultural destruction, and the tragic consequences of inflexibility. Written in English but infused with Igbo proverbs and worldview, it pioneered African literature in English. The novel's title from Yeats captures the disintegration of traditional life under colonial pressure. Essential reading for understanding colonialism's impact and African perspectives on this history.",

Westover examines domestic violence, religious extremism, and the tension between loyalty and self-preservation with brutal honesty.

Through Esther's descent into depression and her struggle with societal expectations of women in the 1950s, Plath creates a devastating portrait of mental illness. The 'bell jar' metaphor—feeling trapped and suffocated—powerfully captures depression's isolating nature. Plath's sharp prose and dark humor make this both a critique of gender roles and a honest depiction of mental health struggles. Published shortly before Plath's suicide, the novel remains an important work about female identity and mental illness.",
